## Motivation
You could say that the first website I wrote was the one I originally deployed
as an assignment in CS192. We were tasked with telling a bit about ourselves,
and learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.  
Three years later, that site is still up, and probably needs replacing. I'm a
graduate student who loves software development, so what better exercise than to
bootstrap a new webpage myself?  
My secondary hope is that someone reading this will have taken interest in some
simple application development with the tools that I'm using here (ReactJS,
Webpack, etc.). I'm going to try to model this as an application that is put
together simply and effectively, to provide a good model of what this kind of
development is like. I hope that you enjoy your stay!
