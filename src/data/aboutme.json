    "Hi there; I'm Andy Dolan. I'm currently a Master's student in the computer science department at CSU. This semester (Fall of 2018), I'll be a GTA for CS314, one of my all-time-favorite courses. I really enjoy the process of developing software from the ground up, and understanding as much of it as I can. Part of that mentality comes from a desire to always be improving, whether in workflows, environment setup, or tools. Programming provides an amazing amount of satisfaction for me; it's both a creative endeavor (not unlike writing a short story), and a productive one.",
    "I also love efficiency and cleanliness in programming - I strive to write better, and do it faster!"
